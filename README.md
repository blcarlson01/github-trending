# GitHub Trending(Python)


## Intro
Tracking the most popular Java Github repos, updated daily(Python version)

inspired by [github-trending(Go Version)](https://github.com/josephyzhou/github-trending)
inspired by and forked from https://github.com/bonfy/github-trending
bonfy's special day:
- [2017-03-29](https://github.com/bonfy/github-trending/blob/master/2017-03-29.md) - my repo [qiandao](https://github.com/bonfy/qiandao) record by github-trending(python)

Most of the below are still bonfy's comments.  Will update as needed as I'm focused on Java Projects.


## Run

You need install `pyquery` & `requests`

```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/bonfy/github-trending.git
  $ cd github-trending
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  $ python scraper.py
```

## Advance

A better place to use the script is in VPS

* You should have a VPS first, and then you should Add SSH Keys of your VPS to Github

* Then you can run the code in VPS

Thus the code will run never stop

## Lisence
